    "Use floats when convenience and speed matter. A float gives you an approximation of the number you declare.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use decimals when precision matters. Decimals can suffer from their own precision issues, but generally, decimals are more\n",
    "precise than floats. The performance difference between float and decimal, with Python 3, is not outlandish, and in my \n",
    "experience, the precision benefits of a decimal outweigh the performance benefits of a float.\n",

    "Q2\n",
    "Both values are same but internal representation at storage Is different. Precsion differs, Decimal('1.200') gives internally \n",
    "1.200 and Decimal('1.2') gives 1.2.\n",

    "Floating-point value is converted to Decimal format. Decimal can store float value with absolute precision. But when float \n",
    "value is given as Decimal object,it first has to be converted from floating point value which might already have rounding error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence it is preferable to start a Decimal object with a string.\n",
